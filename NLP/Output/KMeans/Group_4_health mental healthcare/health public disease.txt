Public health refers to the efforts made to protect and improve the health of populations. This includes government policies, education, vaccination programs, and community-based interventions. Public health initiatives aim to reduce the incidence of disease, promote healthy lifestyles, and ensure access to healthcare services. The global focus on addressing non-communicable diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, as well as infectious diseases, is reshaping how public health professionals approach global health challenges.
