Space exploration is the study of outer space through advanced technology, telescopes, and human spaceflight. The human journey into space began in the mid-20th century with missions like the Apollo moon landings. Today, space agencies such as NASA and private companies like SpaceX are continuing the search for new frontiers, with plans to send humans to Mars and beyond. Discoveries of exoplanets, black holes, and other cosmic phenomena are expanding our understanding of the universe.
