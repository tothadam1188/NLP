Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The field of AI has rapidly advanced, leading to innovations in areas such as machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics. AI systems are capable of analyzing vast amounts of data to recognize patterns, make decisions, and even learn from experience. As AI continues to evolve, its impact on industries like healthcare, finance, and transportation will be profound.
