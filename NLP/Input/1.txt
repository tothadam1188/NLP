Theoretical Computer Science is sometimes seen as a structural science, sometimes as a formal science. Using abstraction and formal modelling, it explores the foundations of Computer Science (the structure, processing, transmission, and reproduction of information). For this purpose, Theoretical Computer Science exploits mathematical methods and structures that differ from those of classical engineering mathematics and that have been further developed especially for Computer Science or have been invented from scratch. The objective of Theoretical Computer Science is to convey the most important terms and concepts for the formal description and analysis of IT systems (software/hardware). One of the goals is to be able to unambiguously describe, analyze, and manipulate computer artifacts such as algorithms and data structures in sufficient detail; however, algorithms and data structures belong to the discipline of Practical Computer Science. Similarly, digital circuit logic is part of Computer Engineering, whereas the formal basics required for this are taught in the field of Theoretical Computer Science.
