Sports are activities that involve physical exertion and skill, often in the form of competition. They have been an essential part of human culture for centuries, promoting physical health, teamwork, and discipline. From team sports like soccer and basketball to individual pursuits like running and swimming, sports offer numerous benefits, including improving cardiovascular health, building muscle strength, and enhancing mental well-being. Fitness, on the other hand, refers to overall physical health and the ability to perform daily activities with vigor.
